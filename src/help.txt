`harp` is a program that helps store and retrieve paths, stored in registers that are separated by sections.

A section is the highest level key, that stores a bunch of registers inside of it.
Each register is also a key, but the value of a register is an object, that has the properties path, line, column.
A register needs to have at least one of those properties filled with data.
Outside of that, it's up to you which (if not all) of the three a given register will store.

Examples:
  `harp update marks a --path ~/here/is/my/path --line 23 --column 36`
  Will store all three properties in the register called "a" (can be any string), under the section called "marks" (can also be any string).

  Important to note: the action is called `update` because it overrides only the properties you pass into it.
  If a register previously had all three properties set and you do:
  `harp update marks a --path ~/a/different/path`
  , then only the path will be updated, while line and column will hold the old value.
  If you want to clear them, check out the `clear` subcommand explained later in this help page.

  `harp get marks a --path`
  Will now print "~/here/is/my/path". On the contrary,

  `harp get marks a`
  Would print the following:
  ~/here/is/my/path
  23
  36

  So if you don't specify any flags for the `get` action, all available properties in a register will be printed, separated by newlines.
  If you do specify flags, only those properties will be printed.
  Regardless of whether you did or didn't, the order will always be path, line, column.

  The `clear` subcommand does exactly what you expect it to do.
  If you only specify the section to `clear` like:
  `harp clear marks`
  , the entire section and all its registers will be deleted (be careful!).
  However, if you specify the register too, only that register's entry will be deleted from the section, while every other register in the section will stay intact.
  `harp clear marks a`

  If, for example, you want to remove the properties line and column in an entry, and change the path, you would do this:
  `harp clear marks a`
  and then:
  `harp update marks a --path ~/my/new/path`
